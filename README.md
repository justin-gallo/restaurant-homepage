# restaurant-homepage
A restaurant homepage to practice building with webpack.

## Things I Learned: 

- Webpack (and module bundling in general) is REALLY cool.
- ES6 modules for organizing code is really useful, and significantly increases readability of my code. 
- Improved my functional programming skills. I could have created each menu item by hand, but instead created a function to reduce repetitive code. 
- Learned how to include a favicon on the page's tab. 

## Things to Improve: 

- I'd like to improve the responsiveness of the "About" page. The current layout is fine for mobile and tablet, but for the desktop layout I'd prefer the map to shift to a right column with the information on the left of it. This should make better use of the space available on wider devices and will reduce the need to scroll.
